# GettingandCleaningdata 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data 
that can be used for later analysis. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. Here are the data for the
project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
R script run_analysis.R perform following

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
